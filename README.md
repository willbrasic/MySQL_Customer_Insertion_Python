# MySQL_Customer_Insertion_Python

The purpose of the latter .ipynb file is to create a sample MySQL database.


The purpose of the main program "MySQL_Customer_Insertion_Python.ipynb" is to design a program that enters a new customer into the customer table in the 'CoffeeDB' database.

This program checks if the customer number entered by the user already exists. 
If it does then the program will display that information.
If it does not then the user will be prompted to enter the information for a new record which will be committed to the customer table in the 'CoffeeDB' database.
